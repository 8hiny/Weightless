# Weightless-1.20.1

## Overview
Weightless is a small fabric mod which adds a fun and polished flight mechanic. Players with weightless flight can freely move about in the air without any worry of impending fall damage.

## Features
-A **/weightless** command which is used to grant and revoke flight from players. Requires operator permissions  
-A toggle and autopilot keybind for weightless flight  
-A non-obtrusive speed lines overlay, customizable speed trail, and flight particles  
-A large amount of configurable options relating to the functionality of weightless flight, many with the intent of balancing the mechanic around survival gameplay

## Future Updates
I plan to expand weightless with one or multiple methods to obtain weightless flight in survival mode. Such methods will most likely resemble rituals of some form.  
Also, I will not be porting this mod to other modloaders, though I will probably keep it updated to newer versions of the game.
